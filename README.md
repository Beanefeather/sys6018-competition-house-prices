SYS 6018: House Prices Kaggle Competition
Team Roles

Our team truly enjoyed working together on this Kaggle competition. While none of us have extensive backgrounds in crafting non-parametric models or even programming in R, we put our heads together to deliver a product of our hard work and innovation. The steps of this project included getting together and brainstorming an initial parametric model, taking some time to think about what we needed for our following submissions, understanding the algorithm of the K-Nearest Neighbors approach, and implementing the steps needed to solve our problem. This proved to be a challenging, yet intriguing task for us and we all worked towards our individual strengths to produce our deliverable. The below roles were discussed before the start of the project, and were subsequently altered as our thinking and understanding of the problem changed. 

Lucas was the “main coder” when it came to the crux of the project; implementing the Knn approach in R. Much of his work also involved designing the Euclidean Distance function which proved to be essential by the end of the project. Additionally, he discovered how to utilize the “dummy” package that enabled us to create dummy variables for our categorical variables. 

Navin was able to figure out the one-hot encoding for our categorical variables, which enabled us to use these variables in our final model. He then used this knowledge to improve upon our original parametric model. Additionally, Navin was our big-picture teammate who helped us visualize and understand the algorithm necessary for the implementing the Knn approach. 

Ashwanth came up with the initial parametric submission and served as the designated function and code “tester” in order to make sure that the code was scalable and comprehensible. Additionally, Ashwanth assisted in normalizing the data (so that all of the variables had values between 0 and 1) which furthered our approach.

Ultimately, our team worked in concert with each other and our final results are a product of our diligent work. Each member played a large part in the completion of the project, whether it was spearheading an idea or checking an approach.
